this directory structure contains binary files that will be fed into tests

the first level contains directories for each test and an "[[all]]" directory,
 that will be used for all tests

the second level contains "accept" and "fail" directories that contains files
 that shall be accepted or rejected respectively

the "[[empty]]" folder will be used iff there is no folder with a matching name.
 this is basically a starting point for new tests. "[[empty]]" tests will check
 against "[[all]]"
